# soundcloud-playlist-copy
Short script to add tracks from a public playlist to one of yours. Not using soundcloud's Client IDs.

I was searching for such a program but didn't find any. And souncloud haven't implemented after years of demand. The process is slow but it
works. I'm open to suggestions though.

Tracks "not available in your country" will be skipped.

The chromedriver setup line in __main__ might need some tweaking depending on your installation.
